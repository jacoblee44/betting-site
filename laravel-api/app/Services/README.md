# Services

A Service Class, on the other hand, is often used as a way to encapsulate complex or reusable business logic that can be used across different parts of the application.

For instance, you might have a UserService that contains methods for various operations related to users, like creating a user, updating user information, or checking user permissions.

Services are typically stateless, and each method in the service should be independent.

In essence, Service Classes tend to encapsulate behaviors around a specific model or group of models (or "concerns"), and are commonly used across different parts of the application.
