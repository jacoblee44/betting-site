# Enums

Enums, short for enumerations, represent a set of predefined constant values.

They can be particularly useful in Laravel applications to represent a finite set of values for a specific variable (
user roles, order statuses, product categories, and so on),
making your code more readable and reducing the chance of invalid values.

They can help to make your code more readable and less error-prone by replacing 'magic strings' or numbers with
descriptive constants.

Enums would be placed within the App\Enums directory.

To implement this in Laravel, you might want to use a package such as BenSampo/laravel-enum or implement it yourself.
