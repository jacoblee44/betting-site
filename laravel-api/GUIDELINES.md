1. Naming Conventions
    * Always respect Laravel's 7 standard CRUD method names in controllers (`index`, `create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `delete`).
    * Use clear and descriptive names for all classes, methods, and variables.

2. Controllers
    * Controllers should be lean and free from business logic. They should only be responsible for handling requests and responses.
    * For actions that do not fit into the standard CRUD operations, use single-action invokable controllers.

3. Actions
    * Create an Action Class in `App\Actions` for complex operations that involve business logic.
    * An Action Class should have a single clear purpose and should be named accordingly.
    * An Action Class should not maintain state. Each invocation should be independent.
    * Actions Classes should be suffix with `Action`.

4. Services
    * Create a Service class inside `App\Services` for interactions with external services, such as APIs or microservices. 
    * These services should encapsulate all logic related to the external interaction, including error handling and data transformation.
    * Services can also be used to encapsulate complex business operations that involve coordinating multiple actions.
    * Services Classes should be suffix with `Service`.

5. Enums
   * Make use of the `App\Enums` directory to encapsulate sets of constants for specific needs, such as status codes, user roles, etc.
   * Naming convention for Enum Classes should be descriptive enough to convey their purpose. 
   * While it's not necessary to suffix with `Enum`, the name should make it clear that the class defines a set of related constants.

6. Repositories
    * Use the Repository pattern to abstract database queries and ensure your application is database agnostic.
    * All database queries should go through a Repository, not directly from a Controller or Action.
    * Repositories Classes should be suffix with `Repository`.

7. Model Concerns
    * Utilize `App\Models\Concerns` to organize model-specific traits.
    * Feel free to create new Traits for a Model if required, but maintain the established organizational structure and naming conventions.
    * Ensure that traits are single-responsibility and do not overlap in functionality.

8. Helpers
    * Use the `App\Helpers` directory for defining global helper functions that can be used across the application.
    * Helper functions should be small, perform a single task, and be stateless.
    * Ensure helper files are grouped by relevant functionality.
 
9. Code Organization
    * Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). If you find yourself duplicating code, consider creating a new class, method, or helper function.

10. Testing
    * Write unit tests for all actions and services to ensure they behave as expected.
    * Use feature tests to ensure your application's endpoints behave as expected.
    * Mock external services in your tests to ensure they can run independently of any external factors.

11. Documentation
    * Document your code thoroughly. Use comments to explain why your code does what it does, not what it does.
    * Maintain up-to-date documentation for your application's API and other interfaces.

12. Code Reviews
    * Always perform code reviews before merging code into the main branch.
    * Code reviews should check for adherence to these guidelines as well as general code quality.

13. Continuous Integration
    * Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
    * Your CI/CD pipeline should run your test suite and any other quality assurance tools (like a linter or static analysis tool) on every commit.

14. Environment
    * Use environment variables for any configuration values that may vary between environments (development, staging, production).

15. Following Spatie's Laravel Guidelines
    * Spatie's Laravel guidelines provide additional best practices and conventions that you should follow. You can find the guidelines [here](https://spatie.be/guidelines/laravel-php).
